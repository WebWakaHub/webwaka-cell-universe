## I. Ratification Authority

-   **Layer:** Cell
-   **Authority:** Founder
-   **Governance Framework:** BIOLOGICAL_GOVERNANCE_CONSTITUTION.md
-   **Organelle Layer as upstream dependency:** Confirmed

---

## II. Ratified Artifacts

1.  **CELL_LAYER_CONSTITUTION.md:** Defines the structural invariants and boundaries of the Cell layer.
2.  **CELL_CATEGORY_UNIVERSE.md:** Declares the inheritance of the 18 canonical organelle categories.
3.  **CELL_AUDIT_LOG.md:** Verifies the structural integrity of the Cell layer.

All three artifacts are hereby constitutionally sealed.

---

## III. Structural Invariants Locked

-   Cells are reusable capability units.
-   Cells are composed of organelles.
-   Cells belong to exactly one of the 18 categories.
-   Cells cannot span categories.
-   Cells cannot implement business-domain logic.
-   Cross-category orchestration is deferred to the Tissue layer.
-   No renaming of categories.
-   No introduction of a new category universe.

---

## IV. Amendment Procedure

-   Any modification requires constitutional amendment.
-   Must include duplication audit.
-   Must include exhaustiveness validation.
-   Must include Founder ratification.
-   No silent changes permitted.

---

## V. Constitutional Closure Statement

-   The Cell Layer is complete.
-   Structurally sealed.
-   Stable for infinite-scale composition.
-   The Tissue Layer may now proceed.
-   No backward structural mutation is permitted without formal amendment.
