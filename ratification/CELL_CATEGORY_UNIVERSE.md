## I. Declaration of Category Reuse

It is hereby declared that the Cell Layer reuses the 18 canonical organelle categories as defined in the `ORGANELLE_CATEGORY_UNIVERSE.md`. No new category universe is introduced at the Cell layer.

-   Category renaming is prohibited.
-   Category merging is prohibited.
-   Cells must belong to exactly one of the 18 categories.

16. **Location & Geography**
    -   Cells under this category are reusable capability units composed only of organelles from this category.
17. **Intelligence & Automation**
    -   Cells under this category are reusable capability units composed only of organelles from this category.
18. **Experience & Interface**
    -   Cells under this category are reusable capability units composed only of organelles from this category.

## III. Structural Rules

-   A Cell must inherit its category from its composing organelles.
-   A Cell cannot span multiple categories.
-   Cross-category composition is deferred to the Tissue layer.
-   Cells are capability units, not business domains.

---

## IV. Amendment Rule

-   The 18-category universe is inherited from the Organelle layer.
-   Amendment requires constitutional change at the Organelle layer.
